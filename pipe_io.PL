# Pipe is the output in prompt from exterior cmd.
# which is different from file in local and streaming in sockets.
# - is a cmd symbol
# | means pipe, the data from the return result of cmd , writting into the program thru pipe
# < > means file handler, also meaning "STDIN" (standard Input),input from prompt 

# to read the return result from cmd into pipe in promt
